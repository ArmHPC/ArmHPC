Modelling and numerical simulation - considered to be the third pillar of the science after theory and experimentation - is at the heart of multiple domains, which are not only scientific, but also societal, economic, financial, and life ethics.They also appear increasingly as decision-making tools for critical cases like global warming, natural disasters, etc.
Since modelling and simulation are essential for multiple scientific advances, the control of all the aspects of high performance computing - as well as the capacity to exploit the masses of data to tackle the solution of these complex models - is inescapable.
The mission of the scientific computing center of the Institute for Informatics and Automation Problems of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia is to develop and apply high-performance information technologies for science and society in Armenia and beyond, and to deliver scientifically excellent and industry relevant research in the fields of high performance computing.
The center's main visions are:
- Enhance the research profile of the IIAP by joining different scientific groups to employ state-of-the-art high performance computing tools to achieve their research goals.
- Maintain, develop and share many computational expertise to facilitate the working experience with distributed resources, support training and on-going help for users to enable them to use different computational resources in an easy manner.
- Manage a strategy for building a range of high performance computing environments, which will help research groups to use larger national and international facilities such Grid and Cloud computing resources.
- To develop scientific gateways and services to scientific communities using heterogeneous computing infrastructure (grid, clouds, HPC clusters, etc).
- To study and implement widely Green ICT in Armenia.
